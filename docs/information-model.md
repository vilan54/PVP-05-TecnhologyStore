# Information model 

The SPA web application will allow the purchase of products by users.

A **product** will have a name, a description, a category, an image, a price, the number of units there 
is, an average rating, a tag and comments. These comments will have only one message.

Each **tag** will have only one name, as well as the categories.

For each **user** your name, surname, email, password and phone number will be saved. In addition, 
the user will indicate a pseudonym that will be used both to authenticate him/herself and to show 
up in the comments the usersur makes.

A user will have a **cart** where he/she will be able to add products and will have a total price. 
In addition, he/she will also have **orders** where he/she will see the products he/she has already 
purchased.

For each product purchased, a user will be able to leave a **rating** (from 1 to 5) and one or more 
**comments**.
